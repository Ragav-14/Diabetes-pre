# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning 🧠💉

This project uses machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost to predict whether a person has diabetes based on health-related input features.

## 🔧 Features
- Real-time predictions using 8 medical inputs
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with StandardScaler
- Handles missing values with median imputation
- Model evaluation using accuracy, recall, and F1-score
- Final model: XGBoost + SMOTE for improved balance

## 📊 Final Model Performance
- Accuracy: **84%**
- Balanced F1-score: **0.85**
- High recall for diabetic cases
